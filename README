This is also testing git repository:

At first create repository form web browser:
say name is "Hello-world" 

then in ur local computer or form any server(whose hardware information is mapped to the git hub account) do:

Create a new repository from the command line:

touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/gourangakole/Hello-World.git
git push -u origin master

Push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/gourangakole/Hello-World.git
git push -u origin master

N.B: Hello-world should match "Hello-world" (the created repository from browser , this is case-sensitive)

For more info have a look at this documentation:

https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo



**************** use this repo and edit from other server *****************
git clone https://github.com/gourangakole/Hello-World.git
emacs root_finding.cpp (if you want to edit)
git add root_finding.cpp
git commit root_finding.cpp -m "update from lxplus"
git push origin master (NOTE: this time you do not need -u ) this is only need for the first time.
